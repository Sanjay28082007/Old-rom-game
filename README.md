🎮 Old ROM Game (Python Prototype)

A retro-inspired text-based adventure game built entirely in Python, modeled after the style of classic ROM-based games like Pokémon Fire Red.
This project started as a learning experiment while exploring object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, and it demonstrates how classes can be used to structure an entire game.

Currently, the game runs in a menu-based interface (terminal/console).
Future plans include migrating it to a Tkinter GUI, adding visuals, and expanding the mechanics.

✨ Features

Class-based architecture – clean modular design showcasing OOP in Python.

Randomized gameplay – enemies, paths, and encounters vary each time you play.

Menu-driven interface – simple to play and extend.

Battle system prototype – inspired by turn-based RPG mechanics.

Expandable structure – built with future GUI (Tkinter) integration in mind.
